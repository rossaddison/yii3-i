<p>Google Translate included to generate language files ie. ip_lang.php, gateway_lang.php, app.php for a locale.</p>    
<p><a href="https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-php-translate">Examples here</a></p>
<p><a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/details/

<p><b>Steps to get the Json file that must be saved in src/Invoice/google_tranlate_unique_folder</b></p>
<p>1: Download https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem into active c:\wamp64\bin\php\php8.1.12 folder</p>
<p>2: Select your project that you created under https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/iam-admin/serviceaccounts?supportedpurview=project'</p>
<p>3: Click on Actions icon and select Manage Keys</p>
<p>4: Add Key</p>
<p>5: Choose the Json File option and Download the file to src/Invoice/Google_translate_unique_folder</p>
<p>6: You will have to enable the Cloud Translation API and provide your billing details. You will be charged 0 currency</p>
<p>7: Move the file from views/generator/output_overwrite to eg. src/Invoice/Language/{your language}</p>
<p><b>Step to choose a locale for translation: Settings...View...Google Translate...{dropdown}...save</b></p>
<p><b>Steps to generate eg. ip_lang.php</b></p>
<p>1: Generator ...Translate English\ip_lang.php</p>
<p>2: Either copy the array from off the screen or move it from ..resources/views/generator/output_overwrite into the appropriate folder</p>
<P>3. The separator ie. 'YYYY' will enable you to do a search and replace ie search 'YYYY' and replace ', to provide a comma separating each array item from the screen outputted array with a comma.</p>
<p>4. Dont forget to restart Netbeans 16 after adjusting C:\Program Files\NetBeans-16\netbeans\etc\netbeans.conf and inserting <code>"-J-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8"</code>  to parameter "netbeans_default_options". when dealing with languages with special characters.</p>
<p><b>26th December 2022</b></p>
<p>Include additional demo languages</p>
<p><b>24th December 2022</b></p>
<p>1. Retesting Sending of invoices by email.</p>
<p>2. Remove 55 Psalm Errors mostly related to <a href="https://github.com/rossaddison/yii3-i/issues/5">Issue #5</a>
<p>3. Psalm Level 7,6,5,4 Testing using Psalm 5.4 instead of 4.3</p>    
<p>4. Auditing of Setting...View...Invoice...Default Public Template and Mark Invoices Sent Copy</p>.
<p>5. Moved rossaddison/yii-invoice to rossaddison/yii3-i.</p>
<p>6. Resynced rossaddison/yii-invoice fork.</p>
<p><b>20th December 2022</b></p>
<p>1. Moved repository into separate working folder under blog, and blog-api for separate github workflow purposes.</p>
<p>2. Invoice works separately from blog. There are no hyperlinks to blog.</p>
<p>3. The Entity User's relations to comment and post have been removed since these are no longer needed.<br>
However the user that is registered under the demo still has to be added to the userinv table using Setting...User Account.    
</p>
<p>4. New Setting: <b>Invoices marked as 'sent' when copying</b> so that a client can view them online immediately without having to be sent by email. See Settings...View...Invoices...Other Settings. This is also useful for testing a series of invoices against a payment gateway.</p>
<p>5. A checkbox 'sandbox' has been added to the SettingsRepository/payment_gateways array for amazon_pay, and braintree.
If you plan to use a language other than English, you will need to include <code>'online_payment_sandbox' => 'Sandbox',</code> in the corresponding src/Invoice/Language/{your_language}/gateway_lang.php file. 
ie. check that the gateway_lang.php in the English folder corresponds with your language folder.
<p>6. The omnipay payment gateway with stripe will give the following warning (which is not recommended to accept): </p>
<p>Payment failed. Please try again. Response: Sending credit card numbers directly to the Stripe API is generally unsafe. We suggest you use test tokens that map to the test card you are using, see https://stripe.com/docs/testing.</p>
<p>You will have to go into https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/integration and toggle the following screen.</p>
<img src="/stripe" height="300" width="600">
<p>7. Github Static Analysis: Psalm Level 7,6,5,4 testing - errors 0</p>
<p>8. The function src\User\Console\AssignRoleCommand and CreateCommand is functional as the observer role can be assigned to a client with the result ending up as an assignment in ...invoices/resources/rbac</p>
<p>How to reach Psalm level 4 the following code is needed to suppress Psalm errors on level 4: </p>
<p>9. Braintree Payment Gateway has been introduced. </p>
<code>
    /**
     * @psalm-suppress InvalidReturnType, InvalidReturnStatement, UndefinedInterfaceMethod
     */
</code>
<p>This will need to be looked at later.</p>     
<p><b>10th December 2022</b></p>
<p>Github Static Analysis: Psalm Level 7,6,5,4 testing - errors 0</p>
<p>1. Payment and Merchant (Online log) views upgraded to GridView.</p>
<p>2. A subarray has been added to the gateway array under SettingRepository/payment_gateways function <code>'version' => array(
                    'type' => 'checkbox',
                    'label' => 'Omnipay Version'                    
                    )</code><br>This is to facilitate the introduction of PCI compliant gateways. The two pci compliant tested gateways introduced here are: Stripe version 10 and Amazon_Pay. </p>
<p>3. If the above 'Omnipay version' checkbox is left unchecked for the specific gateway, you are implying that it is PCI compliant.</p>
<p>4. Uncheck 'Omnipay version' for Stripe Version 10 and the latest Amazon_Pay which have been introduced here.  </p>
<p>5. The guest url has been removed from the guest view. The user/client when logged in with 'observer role', has a list of enabled gateways in a list under options under the guest's invoice view. </p> 
<p>6. Stripe version 10 is PCI compliant because their js.stripe.com/v3 cdn is dealt with directly and no credit card details are shared. </p>
<p>7. Amazon Pay is PCI compliant because the user/client has to be logged into amazon.co.uk before they can use the Amazon Button. No credit card details are shared. </p>
<p>8. The PaymentInformationForm includes place to enter credit card details but this form only presents itself with Omnipay version checked gateways.
<p>9. The PaymentInformationController handles Omnipay and PCI compliant gateways.</p>
<p>10. Amazon_Pay has been integrated with productType set to PayOnly (see function form) so clients can pay if they have an Amazon Account.  </p>
<p>11. Register as a developer under Stripe to test the Omnipay Integration.
<p>12. The following code under ...resources/views/invoice/paymentinformation/payment_information_stripe_pci is of importance.</p>    
<p><code>. 'async function initialize() {'<br>
        // To avoid Error 422 Unprocessible entity <br>
        // const { clientSecret } = await fetch("/create.php", {<br>
        // method: "POST",<br>
        // headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },<br>
        // body: JSON.stringify({ items }),<br>
        // }).then((r) => r.json());<br>    
        . 'const { clientSecret } = {"clientSecret": "'. $client_secret .'"};'<br>
        . 'elements = stripe.elements({ clientSecret });'<br>
        . 'const paymentElementOptions = {'<br>
            . 'layout: "tabs"'<br>
        . '};'<br>
        . 'const paymentElement = elements.create("payment", paymentElementOptions);'<br>
        . 'paymentElement.mount("#payment-element");'<br>
    . '}'<br>
    </code>
</p>
<p>13. Stripe version 10 is working for debit/credit cards and for bacs. Login as a user with observer role.</p>
<img src="/stripe_v_10" height="300" width="450"/>
<p>14. Amazon Pay v2.40 is working if you are signed in to Amazon concurrently. Login as a user with observer role.</p>
<img src="/amazon_pay_v_2_40" height="300" width="450"/>
<p>15. The PaymentController and MerchantController guest related functions adopt the same approach as the InvController:</p>
<p><code>
        // Get the current user and determine from (@see Settings...User Account) whether they have been given <br>
        // either guest or admin rights. These rights are unrelated to rbac and serve as a second <br>
        // 'line of defense' to support role based admin control. <br>
        <br> 
        // Retrieve the user from Yii-Demo's list of users in the User Table <br>
        $user = $this->user_service->getUser(); <br>         
        <br>
        // Use this user's id to see whether a user has been setup under UserInv ie. yii-invoice's list of users <br>
        $userinv = ($uiR->repoUserInvUserIdcount((string)$user->getId()) > 0 <br>
                 ? $uiR->repoUserInvUserIdquery((string)$user->getId()) <br>
                 : null); <br>
        <br>        
        // Determine what clients have been allocated to this user (@see Settings...User Account) <br>
        // by looking at UserClient table <br>       
        <br>                
        // eg. If the user is a guest-accountant, they will have been allocated certain clients <br>
        // A user-quest-accountant will be allocated a series of clients <br>
        // A user-guest-client will be allocated their client number by the administrator so that <br>
        // they can view their invoices and make payment <br>
        $user_clients = (null!== $userinv ? $ucR->get_assigned_to_user($user->getId()) : []);</code>

<p><b>5th August 2022</b> - The Dashboard has been put up. Once Sumex is further developed it will be added to the dashboard. Accessible by menu: Dashboard </p>
<p>To avoid issues concerning psr3 and unvoided return types in mpdf/mpdf I have forked the latest mpdf/mpdf development repo and made adjustments to the relevant files. </p>
<p>The fork rossaddison/mpdf has been included in the composer.json file. Although at this stage it will run using version mpdf/mpdf 8.016, using psr 2, I have the reassurance that these errors concerning void will not show up in Yii</p> 
<p><b>29th July 2022</b> - Psalm testing using 'php ./vendor/bin/psalm' at command prompt - static errors removed. Info issues reduced from 2800 to 2000.</p>
<p>The client view now includes client's details, quotes, invoices, notes, and custom fields tabs.</p>
<p>Relevant javascript has been added to client.js ... load_client_notes, and save_client_notes.</p>
<b>21st July 2022</b>
<p>Invoice/Layout/main.php has been moved to @views/layout/invoice.php. The cldr setting value is given the $session->get('_language') value by means of the locale dropdown.</p>
<p>The $s value is configured for the @views/layout/invoice.php. (different to the demo layout ie. views/layout/main.php) in config/params.php yii-soft/view Reference::to and NOT by means of the InvoiceController .
   The $s value is necessary in this layout to record the current locale in the cldr setting if it is selected BEFORE login. ie. 
<code>$s->save_session_locale_to_cldr($session->get('_language') ?? ($s->get_setting('cldr') ? $s->get_setting('cldr') : 'en'));</code>
<p></p>
<p>jquery 1.13.2 which has just been released is now the default. jquery 1.13.0 has been removed. </p>
<p>In demo mode, the menu now includes the ability to test data with pre-setup clients, products, groups, tax rates. A deinstall feature of demo clients(2), products(2) is available. </p><!-- comment -->
<p>Two additional settings under the Settings tab-index help with this eg. Install test data and Use test data. These work with Generator...Remove Test Data...Reset Test Data</p>
<p>Datepickers now change automatically according to the locale dropdown with eg. views/client/form.php javascript function at the bottom.</p>
<p>Individual datepickers have been removed, and only one datepicker is used on the @views/layout/invoice.php page.

<p><b>9th July 2022</b> - Psalm testing using ./vendor/bin/psalm at the command prompt is now complete. 155 static errors and redundant code removed.</p>
<p><s><a href="https://github.com/yiisoft/demo/issues/439" >Issue 439: BelongsTo relation not updating on edit of relation field eg. Product' relation field tax rate is not editing and updating.</a></s> 
<s>Absolute Clear Cache path is located under SettingsController clear function and it will have to be adjusted to your setup in debug mode. </s>   
<s>public function clear() $directory = "C:\wamp64\www\yii-invoice\public\assets";</s>
<p>The SettingsController clear cache function is functional without an absolute path now.</p>
<p>The LAMP administrator will have to add sufficient permission to the public assets folder using the <code>sudo chown -R username folderpath </code> command before assets can be deleted in debug mode.</p>
<p>Quote - The Quote is functional ie. can be pdf'd <s>but the emailing aspect has to be developed.</s>and the emailing aspect has been tested with sendmail. Testing with SMTP is in progress.</p>
<p>Invoice - The Invoice is functional ie. can be pdf'd and archived <s>but the emailing aspect has to be developed.</s> and sendmail is functional. </p> 
<p>Recurring invoices - Functional but not fully tested.</p>
<p>Payment - Can be recorded against an Invoice. The latest version in League/Omnipay v3.2 will be setup with a few of the major payment providers added to the composer.json</p>
<p>User Custom Fields - not started yet.</p>
<p>File Attachments - not started yet. </p>
<p>Settings...View(Debug mode ie. Red) - These are being used.</p>
<p>Settings...View(Non-Debug mode ie. Not Red) - Some are being used. Their functionality is currently being analysed in Invoiceplane.--</p>
<p>The userinv table is an extension of yii/demo's user table and contains all the critical user information.</p>
</p>
<b>Setting Up</b>
<p>The settings table builds up initially with a default array of settings via the InvoiceController if they do not exist ie. setting 'default_settings_exist' does not exist.</p>
<b>Generator</b>
<p>The code generator templates have been adapted according to the latest demo updates.</p>
<b>Annotations</b>
<p>The lengthy Entity annotations have been replaced with the more concise Attributes coding structure. eg. <code> * @ORM\Column(type="string")</code>
    replaced with <code>#[ORM\Column(type: "string")]</code>. <s>However issue 439 is currently relevant here.</s>  
</p>
<b>Demo Mode</b>
<p>A demo mode variable located in src\Invoice\Layout\main.php ie. <code>$demo_mode</code> can be set to false to remove performance settings and the clear cache tool.
All areas in red will be removed.</p>
<b>Jquery</b>
<p>Jquery  3.6.0 (March 2nd 2021) version is being used for custom fields, and smaller modals. Temporarily, Invoiceplane's dependencies.js file is being used in AppAsset.
The modals are dependent on it. </p>
<b>Html Tags on Views</b>
<p>Views can be improved with more Yii related tags ie. using <code>Html::tag</code>. Html::encode is mandatory or compulsory or always present.</p>
<b>Paginator</b>
<p>The length of the lists can be changed via setting/view: <code>default_list_limit</code></p>
<b>Locales</b>
<p>The SettingRepository <code>load_language_folder</code> function accepts the dropdown locale through yiisoft/demo's <code>$session->get('_language')</code> function: this setting takes precedence over the database 'default_language' setting when set.</p>
<b>Client's language different to locale_derived_language or fallback settings 'default_language'</b>
<p>When printing occurs, the client's language ensures the documentation is printed out in his/her language using <code>$session->get('print_language')</code>
<p>The session variable <code>print_language</code> is reset after printing.</p>    
<b>Languages</b>
<p>Any words used not in the Invoiceplane folders, will be translated using Yii's translation methodology.</p>
<p>The above menu's language can be created in ...resources/messages for a specific language.
<p>Language folders can be imported from Invoiceplane but the following code must be inserted in each file <code>declare(strict_types=1);</code>within that folder.</p>
<b>Steps to include a language</b>
<p>1. Include the language folder in src/Invoice/Language after including declare(strict_types) in each file.</p>
<p>2. Include the new language in SettingsRepository's locale_language_array</p>
<p>3. Adjust the config/params.php locales array.</p>
<p>4. Adjust the views/layout/main.php menu.</p>
<p>5. Adjust each of the resources/messages folders language array.</p>
<p>6. CJK (C(hinese) J(apanese) K(orean) Languages <a href="https://mpdf.github.io/fonts-languages/cjk-languages.html"></a>
In order to view a file with non-embedded CJK (chinese-japanese-korean) fonts, you - and other users - need to download the Asian font pack for Adobe Reader for the languages:

Chinese (Simplified),
Chinese (Traditional),
Korean,
and Japanese

<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/windows-font-packs-32-bit-reader.html">For Windows</a>
<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/macintosh-font-packs�acrobat�reader-.html">For Mac</a></p>
<p>If spaces appear where the language should appear whilst viewing using eg. Chrome default PDF reader, add the extension - Chrome PDF Viewer 2.3.164.</p>
<p>7. When copying, and pasting the Chinese Simplified folder make sure that you remove the space between the Chinese and Simplified. ie. ChineseSimplified. This is camelcase. </p>
<b>Netbeans: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59800221/gradle-netbeans-howto-set-encoding-to-utf-8-in-editor-and-compiler">How to include UTF-8 in Netbeans</a></b>
<p>Set encoding used in Netbeans globally to UTF-8. Added in netbeans.conf "-J-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8" to parameter "netbeans_default_options". This unfortunately has
to be done everytime you edit a file with 'special letters'. So edit the file with the UTF-8 setting above, save it, and then remove the above setting from Netbeans.conf. </p> 
<p>File Location: C:\Program Files\NetBeans-16\netbeans\etc\netbeans.conf open with notepad cntrl+F netbeans_default_options </p>
<b>Improved Features</b>
<p>A start tax year date eg. 06/04/2022 can be setup under view so that reports will use this by default as their start date.</p>
<p>The invoice aging report includes the invoice number(s) of the outstanding balance.</p>
<p>The Sales by Client report includes more specifics including the Sales without Tax, Item Tax, and Invoice Tax, and Sales Inclusive amount.</p>
<p>The Sales by Date (aka Sales by Year) report breaks each Sales per Client into quarters over the selected years.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Multiple products of quantity of 1 can be selected from the products lookup with the 'burger' or '3 horizontal lines' icon whilst in quote.</p>
<p>Multiple items can be deleted under the options button with 'Delete Item'.</p>
<p>Company details are divided into public and private. The profile table is intended for multiple profiles especially when email addresses, and mobile numbers change.</p>
<p>If a Tax -Rate is set to default, it will be used on all new quotes and invoices. ie. A Quote Tax Rate will be created from this Tax Rate automatically and will be created and used on all new quotes. The same will apply to all invoices.</p>
<p>If you want to create a quote or an invoice group, specific to a client, use the Setting...Group feature to setup a Group identifier eg. JOE for the  JOE Ltd Company. The next id will be appended to JOE ie. JOE001.</p>
<p>Products and Tasks can be entered separately on an invoice and are mutually exclusive so if you enter a task you cannot enter a product at the same time.</p>
<b>Deprecated Original Features</b>
<p>Themes will be introduced at a later date.</p>
<p>It is not intended to deprecate any of the features currently in InvoicePlane.</p>
<b>Proposed Features</b>
<p>Upgrading the forms to include the demo's php or server based form structure.</p>
<p>An interlinked basic bookkeeping system to audit transactions and produce an audit trail of invoices and payments</p>
<b>Security</b>
<p>All Entity properties initialized before the construct should be private. The private property is accessed through a public getter method as built below the construct.</p>
<b>Reasons for using a simplified <code>id</code> as a primary key in all the tables</b>
<p>See <a href="https://cycle-orm.dev/docs/annotated-relations/1.x/en#belongsto">{relationName}_{outerKey}</a>, the outerKey being the primary key, structure. 
    Eg. the field <code>tax_rate_id</code> in the Product table is a relation or a foreign key in the Product table equal and pointing to its parent table's Tax Rate's <code>id</code>  
    so the relation name <b>variable</b> in Entity: Product must be <code>$tax_rate</code> and joined with the outerKey as <code>$id</code> you get <code>$tax_rate_id</code> which matches the foreign key <code>$tax_rate_id</code> in Entity: Product
    If the primary key in the Tax Rate table was named something like tax_rate_id and not id then the relation could not be given a name.
</p>
<b>Future Work</b>
<p>Psalm static testing and removing of INFO suggestions.</p>
<p>Yiisoft's Mailer function incorporated using adminEmail as default config param for userinv->email.</p>
<p>A new feature of product custom fields has to be developed.</p>
<p>Client Custom Fields dependency on client_custom_fields.js will be removed as has been done for Payment Custom Fields. </p>
<p>Redundant functions generated by the Generator have to be deleted.</p>
<b>Work in progress</b>
<p>The client/view has been developed but the index under the Client View has to be rebuilt using the code similar to the new Invoice index.</p>
<p>The dashboard is being developed with Sumex still to be incorporated.</p>
<p>All the settings in the setting view,  still have to be linked to their specific purpose by consulting with the Original Invoiceplane code. Progress on this has been made especially with the Email tab.</p>
<p>All forms have to be modified from Html to Yii3's php based form structure.
<p>Email Template</p>
<p>User custom fields have to be developed.</p>
<p>Accessing a quote using the url_key in the browser is possible now by a customer. The url_key is retrieved at the bottom of the  quote by admin and pasted into an email. Login as a user who has the observer role with user_id 7, (after the 6 dummy users in demo) to test the customer's login ability. The customer can be sent the url_key (instead of the actual quote) by email. The user can then accept or reject the quote online using this url_key. This quote can then be copied to an invoice by the administrator if accepted by the customer.</p>
