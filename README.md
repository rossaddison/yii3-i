Yii3 Invoice

Introduction

**An invoicing system using Yii3 Demo's composer.json with additions.  The database is structured around Invoiceplane's database schema. It is intended to continue to use the rossaddison/yii-invoice fork of yiisoft/demo as a test bed for new innovations that the Yiisoft team introduce. Currently 3 payment gateways have been introduced namely Amazon Pay, Braintree, and Stripe. **
